# üìÖ Meeting Scheduler App

This project is a **Meeting Scheduler** app built with Android, designed to help users manage and get reminders for their meetings. The app leverages Android's native capabilities such as `Fragments`, `SQLite`, `AlarmManager`, and `Notifications` to deliver a smooth and responsive user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Java (Android SDK)**: The primary language for building the app, using Android's SDK for activity and fragment management, background services, notifications, and more.
- **MVC Architecture**: The app follows the **Model-View-Controller** design pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data.
- **SQLite Database**: Used to store and persist the meeting data locally on the device. This allows the app to function offline and ensure data is available across app sessions.
- **AlarmManager**: Utilized to schedule reminders for upcoming meetings. The app sets alarms based on the meeting time to trigger notifications at the appropriate moment.
- **Notifications**: Android's notification system is used to send alerts to the user when a meeting is about to start, ensuring the user stays informed about their schedule.
- **BroadcastReceiver**: Used to capture alarms from the `AlarmManager` and trigger the notifications to remind the user about upcoming meetings.
- **Fragments**: For a responsive and modular UI, fragments are used to manage different sections of the app, such as the meeting list and the meeting editor.
- **DatePickerDialog & TimePickerDialog**: Android's native dialogs for date and time selection, allowing users to easily set the meeting's date and time.
